# Cut the Rope
A direct copy of [ZeptoLab's CtR Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cut-the-rope/gkddaofiamhgfjmaccfcfpfolpgbeomj). Posted here for those who don't have/want Chrome (or any Chromium browsers).
I also did this for speedrunning purposes. See [here](https://speedrun.com/cut_the_rope).

## Boxes
The extension comes with four boxes-- Cardboard, Fabric, Toy, and Magic. It has no special powers (solutions, telekinesis, or magnets) and no ads (besides Cut the Rope related stuff at the bottom). It took me around 20 minutes to complete. There are a total of 144 stars.

## The app
There is an app version, however I tried running it and it refused to work. You *must* use the extension, the app won't work, unfortunately.

## How to play
Download ZIP and extract. Open index.html and play!
